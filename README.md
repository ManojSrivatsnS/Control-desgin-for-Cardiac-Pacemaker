# Control-desgin-for-Cardiac-Pacemaker

mathematical modelling of heart needs to be carried out such that the cardiac pacemaker transfer function should be amalgamated with that of the heart;

pumping action mainly due to the sinoatrial cell which is present on the heart. This cell characteristics to generate the electrical pulse to heart for making contraction and retraction of the heart and to regulate the pumping of the blood like for normal heart beat is 72 beats per minute. This sinoatrial cell conducts electrical signal to atrioventricular cell and finally to bundle of HIS. 

By using this mathematical relation, we have generated a normal heart beat of the human and this is used as input to the pacemaker mathematical model;

I generated the electrical pulse at the time of signal generation at the SN node. We are using hydroelectric mechanical model of heart for mathematical equations.
