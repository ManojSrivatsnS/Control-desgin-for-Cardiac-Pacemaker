This pumping action mainly due to the sinoatrial cell which is present on the heart.
 This cell characteristics to generate the electrical pulse to heart for making contraction and retraction of the heart and to regulate the pumping of the blood like for normal heart beat is 72 beats per minute. 
 This sinoatrial cell conducts electrical signal to atrioventricular cell and finally to bundle of HIS;
 
 The essential components of the human cardiovascular system are the heart, blood and blood vessels. It includes 
•	the pulmonary circulation, a "loop" through the lungs where blood is oxygenated; and 
•	the systemic circulation, a "loop" through the rest of the body to provide oxygenated blood. 

Any circumstances of motion can be model mathematically based on the free body diagram considered. In this case, we need to consider the pumping motion and the corresponding circulatory motion.

 We can replace the circulation as well as heart chambers that yields for the palpitation of the muscles.
